1. Summary

Oscilloscope warmup:

1) Visualize simple continuous signals:
Visualize the following signals, using the Auto regime and default settings (trigger on a rising edge on CH1). For each signal, take a video of the setup (the source wire and connection of the oscilloscope probe) and the display of the oscilloscope, while varying one of the signal properties (wave shape, frequency, amplitude) using the controls of the source. Signals:
  
  
    i) 










Watch the first 4 oscilloscope videos referenced below.

Take a look at the Rigol 1000 Series oscilloscopes documentation site to see what resources you have in case you need more in-depth knowledge.

The oscilloscope shows continuous varying signals that it detects at the tips of its probes. The
